    "message": "I highly recommend Sourcery Academy for anyone looking to learn front-end development. The courses and lectures are top-notch and cover everything from the basics to advanced techniques. The use of React in the curriculum was particularly helpful for me as a beginner, as it allowed me to quickly understand and build complex pages and components. I went into the program with very little experience, but now I feel confident and capable in my abilities. A big thanks to the Sourcery team!",
